      <h2>7. Modern-Day Slavery: Child Labor in the 21st Century</h2>

        Introduction <br>
        Child labor is a form of modern-day slavery that persists in the 21st century, despite global efforts to eradicate it. Understanding its various forms and the ongoing initiatives to combat it is crucial in addressing this issue.
        
        Forms of Exploitation <br>
        Child labor takes many forms, including:
        
        Trafficking: Children are trafficked for labor, often forced into work under threat or coercion. <br>
        Forced Labor: Children are compelled to work against their will, often in hazardous conditions. <br>
        Debt Bondage: Families in debt may be forced to send their children to work to repay loans, trapping them in a cycle of exploitation. <br></p>

      <p>
        Technological Solutions <br>
Technology can be a powerful tool in identifying and combating child labor. Initiatives like blockchain technology in supply chains ensure transparency and traceability of products, making it harder for unethical practices to go unnoticed. Apps and online platforms can also provide resources and support for child laborers and their families.

Global Initiatives <br>
Global initiatives such as the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aim to end child labor by 2025. The ILO's International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour (IPEC) works with governments, employers, and workers to develop effective policies and programs.

Action Steps <br>
To contribute to the fight against modern-day slavery, readers can: <br>

Support organizations working to end child labor. <br>
Raise awareness about the issue in their communities. <br>
Advocate for stronger laws and better enforcement. <br>
Make informed consumer choices. <br>
By taking these steps, individuals can help create a world where children are free from exploitation and able to enjoy their childhood.
